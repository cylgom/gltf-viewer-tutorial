# Simple glTF viewer
One of our school projects at IMAC was to make a small glTF viewer.
We were also given the opportunity to add a physically-based lighting model
and simple image-based lighting support, so here is the result.
To test it more easily you should use the
[gltf_viewer_metaproject](https://github.com/nullgemm/gltf_viewer_metaproject)
repo, which already includes this one as a submodule.
